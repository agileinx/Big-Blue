                    <p>
                        BigBlue.golf is a live golf scorekeeping service. We make it easier than ever to join golf matches and track how your favorite teams are doing in real time! The days of crowding around the scoreboard to see results are over.<br><br>
    
                        For players, your coach will give you an access code and the match password. After, you will join your group number for that match. After every hole, you will enter the scores of you and your opponents. That's it! We do all the rest. <br><br>
                        
                        For coaches, joining and setting up matches takes only a few minutes. With our easy-to-use UI, you can quickly add golf courses to your dashboard and create matches at those different courses. Once completed, you can begin matches and provide your players with the access code to join.

                    <summary>Is BigBlue.golf Free?</summary>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Yes, our mission is to make live scoring accessible to everyone. This means making our service free to all of our users. However, money doesn't grow on trees, so we will likely find advertisers who want to work with us. We also plan on making a premium service in the future with extra features (don't worry! These will not hinder usability).</p>
